# Implementation of capacity approaching Error Control Codes in FPGA
Capacity Approaching codes are the Turbo codes, which are formed by combining two convolutional codes. 
In this project, I have implemented Encoders and Decoders of Convolutional Codes in VHDL. I have run these codes on Artix 7 xc7a100ticsg324-1L FPGA board. 
The input and output were provided and monitored using Vivado VIO, which is an IP. This is because it provides for a higher number of input and output ports, as compared to those available on the FPGA board itself. 

## Documentation
The codes have been thoroughly documented in their respective folders, in files named "information & Errata.md". 

## Results
I have tested the codes for some sampled inputs and have got correct results on the FPGA board used. 

## Comments
I warmly welcome any suggestions and comments about these codes. To raise any concerns, kindly [mail](ee3180614@iitd.ac.in) me.  

## Special Mentions
I would like to immensely thank my supervisor [Prof. Abhishek Dixit](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~abhishek.dixit/) for inspiring and teaching me the concepts used and for clearing all my confusions. I would also like to thank Ms. Sonali Garg and Mr. Ankit Rajput for their constant help and support.
