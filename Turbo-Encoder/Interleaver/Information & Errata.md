# Interleaver 
## Information
This __VHDL code__ is written with the concept of an S-random interleaver in mind. 
Key specifications:
- The length of the input (m) is currently kept as 16. 
  - This is changed according to the Turbo Encoder by forcing the value of 4 for the generic variable m. 
- The interkleaver output is _not random_. 
- The output follows the S distance property, which is specified by the generic variable s.
